AMPSO: Artificial Multi-Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel artificial multi-swarm PSO which consists of an exploration swarm, an artificial exploitation swarm and an artificial convergence swarm. The exploration swarm is a set of equal-sized sub-swarms randomly distributed around the particles space, the exploitation swarm is artificially generated from a perturbation of the best particle of exploration swarm for a fixed period of iterations, and the convergence swarm is artificially generated from a Gaussian perturbation of the best particle in the exploitation swarm as it is stagnated. The exploration and exploitation operations are alternatively carried out until the evolution rate of the exploitation is smaller than a threshold or the maximum number of iterations is reached. An adaptive inertia weight strategy is applied to different swarms to guarantee their performances of exploration and exploitation. To guarantee the accuracy of the results, a novel diversity scheme based on the positions and fitness values of the particles is proposed to control the exploration, exploitation and convergence processes of the swarms. To mitigate the inefficiency issue due to the use of diversity, two swarm update techniques are proposed to get rid of lousy particles such that nice results can be achieved within a fixed number of iterations. The effectiveness of AMPSO is validated on all of the functions in the CEC2015 test suite, by comparing with a set of comprehensive 16 algorithms, including not only the state-of-the-art PSO variants, but also the most recently well-performing PSO variants and  some other non-PSO optimization algorithms.
